A software architect with 7 years of experience in designing architecture, software engineering, and programming. A remote worker who is able to work synchronously or asynchronously, in team-based or solo-based development.

I am a great leader, able to manage multiple teams on separate projects parallelly, focus on delivering production-grade solutions that not only solve the problem, but also covers certain engineering aspects such as maintainability, testability, scalability, even the skill development of my team members! I helped my previous company to grow from only 6 engineers to 100+ engineers within 4 years.

I did a lot of cool stuff behind the scene, such as leading the development of more than 15 solutions for various clients across the globe, including one of the biggest drilling company in the world, one of the biggest banks in Singapore, and one of the "Big Four" accounting organization in the world.

Other cool stuff from me ...
